##1. Introduction
We focus on customer reviews for restaurantsï¼Œapplying LDA on reviews data.

**Topic model:**
* Unsupervised machine learning based on text data
* One of the most useful algorithm__LDA

**LDA:**
* A collection of distributions on words (topics).
* A distribution on topics for each document(star).


##2. Data Preparation
**Our datasets:**
* yelp_academic_dataset_business.json
* yelp_academic_dataset_reviews.json
** Prepare data:**
* Convert json to csv:

```
#Convert a json string to a flat python dictionary which can be passed into Pandas.

import json
import pandas as pd
from glob import glob
 
def convert(x):

    ob = json.loads(x)
    for k, v in ob.items():
        if isinstance(v, list):
            ob[k] = ','.join(v)
        elif isinstance(v, dict):
            for kk, vv in v.items():
                ob['%s_%s' % (k, kk)] = vv
            del ob[k]
    return ob
 
for json_filename in glob('*.json'):
    csv_filename = '%s.csv' % json_filename[:-5]
    print 'Converting %s to %s' % (json_filename, csv_filename)
    df = pd.DataFrame([convert(line) for line in file(json_filename)])
    df.to_csv(csv_filename, encoding='utf-8', index=False)

```

* Read in R and data preprocessing:

```
# Prepare packages in R for LDA
install.packages("tm")
install.packages("topicmodels")
install.packages("ggplot2")
# Read csv in R and filter reviews for restaurants
data_bus <- read.csv("business.csv", stringsAsFactors=FALSE)

# Find indices of business with "restaurant" as category
loc <- grep("R,e,s,t,a,u", data_bus$categories, perl=TRUE, value=FALSE)
data_bus_subset <- data_bus[loc,]

# Select only restaurant reviews. There are 990627 reviews.
data_review_restaurant <- subset(data_review, data_review$business_id %in% data_bus_subset$business_id &nchar(toString(text)) > 100)
cat("Number of restaurant reviews: "); print(dim(data_review_restaurant))
print(dim(data_review_restaurant)[1]*9/10)

# Separate into training (90%) and testing set (10%)
index <- sample(nrow(data_review_restaurant), nrow(data_review_restaurant)*.9)
data_review_restaurant.train <- data_review_restaurant[index, ]
data_review_restaurant.test <- data_review_restaurant[-index, ]
cat("Training set: "); print(dim(data_review_restaurant.train))
cat("Testing set: "); print(dim(data_review_restaurant.test))
* Key code in getting top 30 topics.
  Each topic has 10 key words. 
  Words in each topic are ordered by decreasing order by frequency.

#####[To wordcloud shinyapps](https://claire-yl3296-presentation.shinyapps.io/wordcloud/)
* Given each star, we can clearly see the key words.
* Interative: Star, Minimum frequency and Maximum Number of Words can be customized.
* Nice way to visualize text mining.
* Here's the R code:
```
#global.R
library(tm)
library(wordcloud)
library(memoise)

# The list of valid books
books <<- list("1Star" = "newt1",
               "2Star" = "newt2",
               "3Star" = "newt3",
               "4Star" = "newt4",
               "5Star" = "newt5")

# Using "memoise" to automatically cache the results
getTermMatrix <- memoise(function(book) {
  # Careful not to let just any name slip in here; a
  # malicious user could manipulate this value.
if (!(book %in% books))
    stop("Unknown book")
  
  a = read.table(sprintf("./%s.txt", book))
  idx = a$word
  a = a[,2]
  names(a) = idx
  sqrt(a)
})

#server.R
function(input, output, session) {
  # Define a reactive expression for the document term matrix
  terms <- reactive({
    # Change when the "update" button is pressed...
    input$update
    # ...but not for anything else
    isolate({
      withProgress({
        setProgress(message = "Processing corpus...")
        getTermMatrix(input$selection)
      })
    })
  })
  
  # Make the wordcloud drawing predictable during a session
  wordcloud_rep <- repeatable(wordcloud)
  
  output$plot <- renderPlot({
    v <- terms()
    wordcloud_rep(names(v), v, scale=c(4,0.5),
                  min.freq = input$freq, max.words=input$max,
                  colors=brewer.pal(8, "Dark2"))
  })
}

# ui.R
fluidPage(
  # Application title
  titlePanel("Word Cloud"),
  
  sidebarLayout(
    # Sidebar with a slider and selection inputs
    sidebarPanel(
      selectInput("selection", "Choose a book:",
                  choices = books),
      actionButton("update", "Change"),
      hr(),
      sliderInput("freq",
                  "Minimum Frequency:",
                  min = 1,  max = 100, value = 5),
      sliderInput("max",
                  "Maximum Number of Words:",
                  min = 1,  max = 150,  value = 100)
    ),
    
    # Show Word Cloud
    mainPanel(
      plotOutput("plot")
    )
  )
)
